TerrainGenerators
=================

Library of gradient noise algorithms with Pygame-based display programs
    configured to run as terrain generators. Also features some dungeon
    map generators unrelated to the noise algorithms.
    
These programs were developed before I had any formal training in software
    development and, in this form, should be used for informative purposes only.

Requires Python 3 and Pygame for Python 3, though it should be easy enough to
    adapt to Python 2 and the associated Pygame version if desired.
